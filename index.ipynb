    "\n",
    "We can apply the the ideas of hypothesis testing in a regression context as well as statistical inference. The general approach of hypothesis testing remains the same i.e. We develop a set of hypotheses including null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis. The way we conduct these tests is that we try to reject the null hypothesis with an associated alpha level as a threshold for calling our results significant , or otherwise. We set some statistic according to the nature of underlying data and analytical question and check the significance of our results. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis Testing in Regression \n",
    "\n",
    "During regression, we try to measure the model parameters (coefficients ) so our null and alternative hypotheses must also get set up in those terms. Think about the simple regression experiment that we conducted on the advertising dataset. For a simple dataset like this, we can set up our hypotheses as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NULL HYPOTHESIS (Ho): There is no relationship between amount spent on TV advertisement and sales figures.**\n",
    "\n",
    "For our null hypothesis to be true, In y= mx+c , m has to be zero so y is simply equal to the intercept. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS (Ha): There is \"some\" relation between amount spent on TV advertisement and sales figures.**\n",
    "\n",
    "So for above, rejecting the null hypothesis would help us associate some significance with our results\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like for statistical significance, we reject the null (and thus believe the alternative) if the 95% confidence interval does not include zero for co-efficient. In other terms \n",
    "\n",
    "#### the p-value represents the probability that the coefficient is actually zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's import the code from our previous lesson and see if we can check for this p value. \n"
